Task 2: Phishing Email Analysis Report

1. Objective

The objective of this task was to analyze a sample email file (.eml) to identify its characteristics and determine if it was a phishing attempt.

2. Tools Used

Operating System: Kali Linux
Terminal Commands: cd, ls, cat
Sample Source: A sample .eml file obtained from a public GitHub repository.
Sample Source Link https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot.
3. Process

Obtain Sample: A safe phishing email sample (sample-1.eml) was downloaded.
Initial Triage: The file was saved and accessed via the Kali Linux terminal.
Static Analysis: The cat command was used to display the raw source of the email, including its headers and body.
Indicator Identification: The headers and body were manually inspected for common phishing red flags.
4. Analysis & Findings

The email sample was conclusively identified as a phishing attempt based on the following indicators:

Header Analysis:

Failed Authentication: The Authentication-Results header showed spf=temperror, dkim=none, and dmarc=temperror. This means the sender's server was not authorized to send emails on behalf of the domain it claimed to be from.
Mismatched Sender Information: The From header displayed the name of a bank, but the Return-Path pointed to a generic and unrelated server hostname (root@ubuntu-s-1vcpu-1gb-35gb-intel-sfo3-06).
Body Analysis:

Social Engineering: The subject line, "Your card has 92,990 LIVELO points expiring today!", created a false sense of urgency to manipulate the user into acting quickly.
Malicious Link: The email body, encoded in Base64, contained a link pointing to a suspicious and non-official domain (blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra[.]me), not the legitimate bank's website.
5. Conclusion

The email is definitively malicious. It uses header forgery to spoof a trusted sender and social engineering tactics to lure the user into clicking a dangerous link. The technical evidence in the headers confirms the email's fraudulent nature.
